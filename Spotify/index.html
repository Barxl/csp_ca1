            <h1>Spotify</h1>
            <p id="1"><b>Spotify</b> Spotify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Swedish">/ˈspɒtɪfaɪ/</a>; Swedish: ([ˈspɔ̂tːɪfaj]) is a Swedish[3] audio streaming and media services provider founded on 23 April 2006 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ek">Daniel Ek</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lorentzon">Martin Lorentzon</a>.[6] It is one of the largest music streaming service providers with over 406 million monthly active users, including 180 million paying subscribers, as of December 2021.[7] Spotify is listed (through a Luxembourg City-domiciled holding company, Spotify Technology S.A.[1]) on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depositary receipts.

            Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded music and podcasts, including more than 82 million songs, from record labels and media companies.[7] As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Spotify is currently available in 180+ countries as of October 2021. Users can search for music based on artist, album, or genre, and can create, edit, and share playlists.
            
            Spotify is available in most of Europe and the Americas, Oceania, with a total availability in 184 markets.[8] The service is available on most modern devices including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">macOS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> computers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS">IOS</a> and ,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> smartphones and tablets, AI-enabled smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, and digital media players like Roku.[9]
            
            Unlike physical or download sales, which pay artists a fixed price per song or album sold, Spotify pays royalties based on the number of artist streams as a proportion of total songs streamed. It distributes approximately 70% of its total revenue to rights holders (often record labels), who then pay artists based on individual agreements.[10] According to Ben Sisario of The New York Times, approximately 13,000 out of seven million artists on Spotify generated $50,000 or more in payments in 2020.[11]</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p id="2">Spotify was founded in 2006 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Sweden,[12] by Daniel Ek, former CTO of Stardoll, and Martin Lorentzon, co-founder of Tradedoubler.[13][14] According to Ek, the company's title was initially misheard from a name shouted by Lorentzon. Later they thought out an etymology of a combination of "spot" and "identify."[15]</p>

            <h3>Early international launches</h3>
            <p id="3">In February 2009, Spotify opened public registration for the free service tier in the United Kingdom.[13] Registrations surged following the release of the mobile service, leading Spotify to halt registration for the free service in September, returning the UK to an invitation-only policy.[16]

            Spotify launched in the United States in July 2011 and offered a six-month, ad-supported trial period during which new users could listen to an unlimited amount of music for free. In January 2012, the free trial periods began to expire, and limited users to ten hours of streaming each month and five plays per song.[17] In March, Spotify removed all limits on the free service tier indefinitely.[18]
            
            In April 2016, Ek and Lorentzon wrote an open letter to Swedish politicians demanding action in three areas that they claimed hindered the company's ability to recruit top talent as Spotify grows, including access to flexible housing, better education in the programming and development fields, and stock options. Ek and Lorentzon wrote that to continue competing in a global economy, politicians needed to respond with new policies, or else thousands of Spotify jobs would be moved from Sweden to the United States.[19]
            
            In February 2017, Spotify announced expansion of its United States operations in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan">Lower Manhattan</a>, New York City, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_World_Trade_Center">4 World Trade Center</a>, adding approximately 1,000 new jobs and retaining 832 existing positions.[20] The company's US headquarters are located in New York City's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatiron_District">Flatiron District</a>.[21]
            
            On 14 November 2018, the company announced a total of 13 new markets in the MENA region, including the creation of a new Arabic hub and several playlists.[22]</p>

            <h2>Business model</h2>
            <p id="4">Spotify operates under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium">freemium</a> business model (basic services are free, while additional features are offered via paid subscriptions). Spotify generates revenue by selling premium streaming subscriptions to users and advertising placements to third parties. Some of the premium options users may choose from include individual, duo, family, and student.[119]

            In December 2013, the company launched a new website, "Spotify for Artists, " explaining its business model and revenue data. Spotify gets its content from major record labels as well as independent artists and pays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright">copyright</a> holders royalties for streaming music. The company pays 70% of its total revenue to rights holders. Spotify for Artists states that the company does not have a fixed per-play rate; instead, it considers factors such as the user's home country and the individual artist's royalty rate. Rightsholders received an average per-play payout between $.000029 and $.0084.[120]
            
            Spotify offers an unlimited subscription package, close to the Open Music Model (OMM) estimated economic equilibrium for the recording industry.[citation needed] However, the incorporation of digital rights management (DRM) limitation[121] diverges from the OMM and competitors such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">iTunes Store</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music">Amazon Music</a> that have dropped DRM.[122][123]
            
            In 2013, Spotify revealed that it paid artists an average of $0.007 per stream. Music Week editor Tim Ingham commented that the figure was not as "alarming" as it appeared, writing: "Unlike buying a CD or download, streaming is not a one-off payment. Hundreds of millions of streams of tracks are happening every day, which quickly multiplies the potential revenues on offer – and is a constant long-term source of income for artists."[124]</p>

            <h3>Accounts and subscriptions</h3>
            <p id="5">As of November 2018, the two Spotify subscription types, all offering unlimited listening time, are:</p>

Spotify also offers an official, although unsupported (developed as a "labour of love" by Spotify engineers; support is offered through the Spotify Community), version of Spotify for Linux clients. Spotify also offers a proprietary protocol known as "Spotify Connect", which lets users listen to music through a wide range of entertainment systems, including speakers, receivers, TVs, cars, and smartwatches. Spotify also has a web player (open.spotify.com).[177] Unlike the apps, the web player does not have the ability to download music for offline listening. In June 2017, Spotify became available as an app through Windows Store.[178][179]</p>
